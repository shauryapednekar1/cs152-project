## CS152 Project Proposal - *AI-Ception*

### Project Description

Today, AI is able to create extremely realistic content. For instance, a significant amount of news articles are written without any human intervention. 
With the rise in AI generated content, it is becoming increasing hard for humans to distinguish between human generated and AI generated content. 
This became increasingly evident to me when I learned of [this](https://this-person-does-not-exist.com/en) that displays pictures of humans that do 
not actually exist. Their website mentions the following:
> "AI is so developed that 90% of fakes are not recognized by an ordinary person and 50% are not recognized by an experienced photographer."

However, since computers don't actually "view" images the same way as humans (as images are essentially just matrices of numbers to computers),
I'm interested to see whether an AI would have a higher success rate in determining images of real human beings from images of AI generated human 
beings.

### Goals
- Understand whether AI is able to tell real data from synthetic data (starting with the "thispersondoesnotexist" website).
- Identify which factors affect AI when telling real data from synthetic data (eg. whether gender/age plays an important role).
- Explore the practical implications of the results of the project.
- Explore the ethical concerns of the rise of super-realistic sythetic data.


### Fun Task

Below are two images of human beings. Identify which image is of a real human being and which one is of someone that doesn't really exist.
